# Collapsible Navbar

The Accordion component is a collapsible UI pattern that displays a list of items, allowing users to toggle their visibility. The Index manages individual item states, ensuring only one item is open at a time. Clicking on an item's children doesn't trigger unintended toggling, providing a user-friendly accordion experience.
